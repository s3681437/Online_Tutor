# FlyingOctopuses
SEPTVN2019

We have successfully deployed this project at link:
https://sept-assignment-2-deploy.appspot.com

p/s: We have tried to implement continuous delivery (automated deployment) with Travis and GAE, however it did not work out as expected. You can check the implementation in the branch Release2B.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

To run the unit tests (15 REST API Mocha testing) at local, goes to folder "Backend" and type "npm test"

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!


### `grunt uglify`

Build the backend server file, that minize the size and make it ready for deployment.
